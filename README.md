# FilGoal Question Answering System Using LangChain

## Project Overview
This project aims to build an **Arabic Question Answering System** using football-related articles. The system leverages **web scraping** to collect relevant data from a football news website and then applies advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to answer questions posed by users.

The system is capable of handling Arabic queries and providing relevant answers based on articles about football, soccer transfers, teams, and leagues.

## Technologies Used
The project makes use of the following libraries and tools:

- **BeautifulSoup4**: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. Used for web scraping.
- **Requests**: A simple HTTP library for making requests to the web and retrieving content.
- **Pandas**: A library used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **FAISS**: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
- **Transformers**: A library by Hugging Face to use pre-trained models for Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically **AraBERT** for Arabic text.
- **LangChain**: A library to simplify the construction of language model-powered applications.
